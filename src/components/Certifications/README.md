The certifications section is basically a duplicate of the Project section. Everything below is from there. I simply duplicated and tweaked so that the section could be updated separately.

# Related GitHub Issues

# Resources

In this section I will provide links to resources being considered in preparation for Projects.

## Card Creation

Eventually settled on [this](https://codepen.io/nikki-peel/pen/RwavQer?editors=1000) for the cards, but it wasn't enough. The code was missing a lot and didn't look right. Had to tweak in order for it to work.

### Bootstrap
