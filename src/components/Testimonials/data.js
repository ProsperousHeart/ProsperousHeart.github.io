I was particularly impressed by Kassandra's ability to handle some critical situations effortlessly. That skill often takes quite some time to develop, but it seemed to come perfectly naturally to her. Irrespective of the project status, Kassandra looks at it with a different lens, and provides recommendations that can help the team in the long run. Thank you, Kassandra, for your detail-oriented skill management. I know you will be an asset for any team.",
