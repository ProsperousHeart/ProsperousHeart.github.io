# About This Site

As a developer, my focus has mostly been on backend work. I have branched out into front end, and this will be my playground. More so - my online resume. It will bring together all of what I want to be seen when speaking with a potential new employer or client.

# Inspirations

The following are themes I liked and wanted to incorporate into my own site. Since none of them were exactly how I wanted, I will be leveraging these templates to determine how I would like to create mine.

## From [BootstrapMade.com](https://bootstrapmade.com/bootstrap-resume-cv-templates/)

1. [Personal](https://bootstrapmade.com/personal-free-resume-bootstrap-template/) - LOVE the color scheme!!! Hate the layout. Like transition of services sections - hard to read, though. Considering pink border, black font, white background with transparency... ?

2. [iPortfolio](https://bootstrapmade.com/iportfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-websites-template/) - very similar to how I was looking to make mine. Not quite right, but definitely close! It's also broken - not everything works properly. Great for a portfolio!

3. [Lonely](https://bootstrapmade.com/free-html-bootstrap-template-lonely/) - love some of these transitions! similar to 1, but instead of menus on left they are at the top.

4. [MyResume](https://bootstrapmade.com/free-html-bootstrap-template-my-resume/) - similar to 1 above, but not quite what I'm looking for.

5. [Kelly](https://bootstrapmade.com/kelly-free-bootstrap-cv-resume-html-template/) - I do not like this layout, but I do like the transitions!

6. [Folio](https://bootstrapmade.com/folio-bootstrap-portfolio-template/) - I like the skills slider transition!

7. [DevFolio](https://bootstrapmade.com/devfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-html-template/) - enjoy the transitions while scrolling and the look of transitions for image icons, menu, important blog post highlights --- could lead them to my blog (need to add a link back to my main page -- this resume)

8. [Laura](https://bootstrapmade.com/laura-free-creative-bootstrap-theme/) - giant photo is unappealing to me. Liked lazy load of numbers & % sleders. Rest is basically the same as the others. Did like the single quotes. Do like the headings. Also has pricing structure - but can add that to events section. I do like the menu at the top being semi-transparent.

## From Start Bootstrap

1. [Freelancer](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/freelancer) - didn't like layout, but it has an example of a new window popping up like I've been looking to do. [Original Source Code](https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-freelancer)

2. [Resume](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume) - first one to catch my eye, but has since fallen behind. I do like the awards section and having my face on the left in a constantly visible frame

## From [UX & Bootstrap](https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/bootstrap-templates/resume/orbit-free-resume-cv-bootstrap-theme-for-developers/)

1. Orbit - a rseume/CV template for designers. [GitHub](https://github.com/xriley/Orbit-Theme) and [live demo](https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/demo/bs5/orbit). Originally site has optional color schemes. Free as long as you keep the footer attribution link.

## From uicookies

Also free with footer credits.

1. [ResumeX](https://uicookies.com/downloads/resumex-resume-portfolio-template/)

2. [Online CV](https://uicookies.com/downloads/online-cv-html-responsive-bootstrap-resume-template/) - similar to the **ResumeX**

## From TechNext

1. [Personal Portfolio](https://themewagon.com/themes/free-bootstrap-4-html5-personal-portfolio-website-template-resume/) - I like how crisp and sharp it looks, but not ht etheme per se. The education section made me want to do something similar with all of the Cisco classes I've done. I like that the scrolls has some margin, while the left hand menu does not.

2. [Noah](https://themewagon.com/themes/free-html5-personal-landing-page-template-noah/) - liked transition of image at top. Skills super clean.

3. [Ronin](https://themewagon.com/themes/ronin-free-bootstrap-4-html5-personal-portfolio-website-template/) - really liked the botton color transition, tools expertness section (clean section); color change for client offerings & project images; social media icon hover changes; simple newsletter sign-up at bottom.

4. [MeetMe](v) - I like the clear image at the top - but would do this at the bottom for about me (since likely longer); could consider top coloration with pink transitions with grey on the front; Ilike how the percentages move; I like the timline for education & expereince; shade on client offerings; how projects are listed

5. [Browny](https://themewagon.com/themes/free-html5-personal-portfolio-website-template-browny/) - I like the button to download my resume; I like about me styling with the social under image; education cool, but would like a sliding thing with explanations of what I learned (optional pop up for course description or link out to the training); experience timeline similar to MeetMe; LOVE the profile section items; clients section

6. [Snow](https://themewagon.com/themes/free-html5-bootstrap-4-personal-portfolio-website-template-snow/) - like the transparent to solid menu; simple numbers; has own blog ... but perhaps I just lead them to different ones on my actual blog (?)

7. [Hola](https://themewagon.com/themes/free-html5-professional-portfolio-website-template-hola/) - LOVE this one ... the top menu disappears too soon; like the words that pop up when hovering over social media icons in header right; blog option made me want to forward all programming from prosperous heart onto this main GitHub one!

8. [Ethan](https://themewagon.com/themes/ethan-free-bootstrap-html5-one-page-personal-portfolio-website-template/) - LOVED the fast color transition; really like that the central image stays as the main image - font just over it (can do that with a white background to ensure easily readable); liked the drop downs for greater explanation; liked the overlay of latest work

9. [Nickie](https://themewagon.com/themes/nickie-free-bootstrap-4-html5-one-page-portfolio-website-template/) - logo at top and buttons for menu sections; cool rotation of potential things to share with people about how I help them; REALLY like the transition of services; BUTTON transitions on Portfolio

10. [Safs](https://themewagon.com/themes/safs-one-page-free-bootstrap-4-html5-personal-portfolio-website-template-web-developer/) - header changes for services; skills; social buttons under image; why choose me section; recent work; FAQ section; team hover (social)

11. [Jackson](https://themewagon.com/themes/free-bootstrap-portfolio-website-template/) - Color scheme is great; liked the simple numbers with image scroll; expertise

12. [Portfolio](https://themewagon.com/themes/bootstrap-4-portfolio-website-template-profile/) - experience; coding skills visual; AWARDS transition; view of circl around the image iff possible

13. [Kards](https://themewagon.com/themes/personal-responsive-vcard-template/) - spinning delay; crisp colors in resume creds (but too long); clear services with sharp color contrast; nice sharp contrast for data before contact

14. [Maze](https://themewagon.com/themes/free-bootstrap-portfolio-template-maze/) - floats above back - and bottom footer is nicely done; subscription section

## Template Flip

1. [Creative CV](https://templateflip.com/templates/creative-cv/) - green overlay with pulsing cirle around face ... would want the left hand side menu to show up once it (& socials) have scrolled past (keeping menu on left); animation on education/experience; portfolio transition

## Write Bootstrap

1. [Geek](https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/geek-resume-portfolio-template-WB0NR38X1?ref=sdr) - menu sections pop out; LOVE the blog design ... top and side bars (hoem default and hoem version 2)
